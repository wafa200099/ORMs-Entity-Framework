## Project Overview

The `PublisherApp` project demonstrates how to use Entity Framework, an ORM tool for .NET, to map C# classes to database tables and perform database operations in a simplified manner. By abstracting the underlying database interactions, Entity Framework allows developers to work with data using strongly-typed C# objects without writing SQL queries directly.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn about:
- Basic ORM concepts
- How to use Entity Framework in a .NET application
- Setting up data models and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

## Features

- **ORM Mapping**: Maps C# classes to database tables using Entity Framework.
- **CRUD Operations**: Demonstrates how to create, retrieve, update, and delete records in the database.
- **Database Migrations**: Showcases how to manage database schema changes using Entity Framework migrations.
- **Console-Based Interaction**: The application is a console app, making it straightforward to run and test ORM operations without a complex UI.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Core**
- **Entity Framework Core**
